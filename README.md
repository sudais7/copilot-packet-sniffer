# Copilot-Assisted Packet Sniffer: Seeing the Network (Ethically)

Author: Sudais Mohamed  
Course: CTEC 450  
Project: Copilot-Assisted Ethical Packet Sniffer  

---

## Project Overview

This project is an ethical packet sniffer built using Python and the Scapy library.  
It reads packets from a `.pcap` file and decodes common network protocols including:

- IP
- TCP
- UDP
- DNS
- HTTP (plaintext only)

The program includes privacy protections such as IP address masking and redaction of sensitive data.

This tool is intended strictly for educational lab use.

## Learning Goals

- Understand packet capture concepts (IP, TCP/UDP, DNS, HTTP)
- Use GitHub Copilot responsibly to assist development
- Implement privacy-preserving safeguards
- Recognize the ethical implications of packet sniffing

---

## Ethical Scope

This tool may only be used:

- On authorized lab `.pcap` files
- On traffic generated by the user
- In instructor-provided environments

Capturing unauthorized network traffic is illegal and unethical.

## Privacy & Redaction Features

To protect sensitive information, the program:

- Masks IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.xxx)
- Redacts emails
- Redacts potential sensitive data in HTTP payloads
- Limits payload preview length
